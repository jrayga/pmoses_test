                        <p class="answer"><strong>Coronaviruses</strong> are a large family of viruses that are found in animals and humans. In humans, they normally cause respiratory ailments. There are many species of coronavirus—in fact, some strains of the common cold are coronaviruses. The diseases SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) and MERS (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome) are also caused by coronaviruses. </p>
                        <p class="answer"><strong>nCoV</strong> (or more completely, the 2019-nCoV or 2019 <strong>N</strong>ovel <strong>Co</strong>rona<strong>v</strong>irus) was the provisional name given to the new (i.e. novel) species of coronavirus that first emerged in Wuhan, China in December of 2019.</p>
                        <p class="answer">Since then, this specific species of the coronavirus has been formally named by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) as the <strong>SARS-CoV-2</strong> (<strong>S</strong>evere <strong>A</strong>cute <strong>R</strong>espiratory <strong>S</strong>yndrome <strong>Co</strong>rona<strong>v</strong>irus <strong>2</strong>). The name of the virus was chosen to signify that it is genetically related to the virus responsible for SARS; however, although they are related, they are not the same virus nor do they cause the same disease.</p>
                        <p class="answer">To further differentiate SARS from the new disease, the World Health Organization (WHO), following guidelines and best practices set forth by the OIE and FAO, named of the disease <strong>COVID-19</strong> (<strong>Co</strong>rona <strong>Vi</strong>rus <strong>D</strong>isease - 20<strong>19</strong>).</p>

                        <p class="answer">In general, many symptoms of COVID-19 are similar to the flu. In most people, symptoms of COVID-19 include fever, tiredness, and a dry cough. Some may have aches and pains, a runny or stuffy nose (nasal congestion), a sore throat, or even diarrhea. All of these symptoms are usually mild and would appear gradually.</p>
                        <p class="answer">Some people who have COVID-19 are asymptomatic—which means that although they’re infected with the disease, they don’t develop any symptoms nor do they feel unwell.</p>
                        <p class="answer">Around eight (8) in every ten (10) people with COVID-19 will recover from it without needing special treatment. However, around one (1) out of every six (6) become very ill and start having difficulty breathing; this is very serious and would require medical care immediately. </p>
                        <p class="answer">Older people and those with underlying medical problems like heart problems, diabetes, hypertension (high blood pressure), lung disease, and cancer are more likely to develop the critical and severe symptoms of COVID-19.</p>

                        How deadly is COVID-19?

                    <div class="answer-wrap">
                        <p class="answer">We are still figuring it out.</p>
                        <p class="answer">Worldwide, around 3.4% of all those that are diagnosed with the disease have died. In general, those over 80 to 85 years old are the most vulnerable with some estimates going as high as 14.8% to 27%, and for those above 55 to 65 years old, 1% to 11% have died.</p>
                        <p class="answer">People between 20 to 54 years old have a less than 1% risk of dying.</p>
                        <p class="answer">However, these numbers may not necessarily give the complete picture because of multiple reasons. The biggest factor is because case fatality rate (CFR) is calculated by comparing the number of deaths among the COVID-19 patients vs. the total number of identified COVID-19 patients. We simply cannot say for certain how many people have been infected unless there is aggressive mass testing. For example, in South Korea, where aggressive testing has been done of the population, the estimated mortality rate is a very low 0.6%.</p>
                        <p class="answer">Another complication is that there’s a delay between people getting infected, developing symptoms that are severe enough to warrant going to the hospital for testing, and death. Because of this delay, the number of deaths used to calculate the CFR is compared with a number of cases that does not match the correct time frame (i.e. deaths counted this week should be used alongside the case-count from two or three weeks ago).</p>
                        <p class="answer">Lastly—but nonetheless significantly—many deaths could be attributed to the limited medical care caused by the medical infrastructure being overwhelmed by the outbreak. Many people who have died might have lived if the healthcare providers and institutions around the world had the ample time, resources, and energy. However, the rapid onset and global scope of the pandemic has overwhelmed the medical care facilities who find themselves unable to cope and thus many possibly preventable deaths occur. This skews the apparent deadliness of the disease itself by incorrectly inflating the number of deaths.</p>
                        <p class="answer">It will take time before the world’s medical experts will be able to properly assess the true deadliness of the disease. Until then, however, it is always better to be safe than sorry and everyone should treat COVID-19 as a very serious and deadly illness. </p>

                        Is COVID-19 airborne?

                        <p class="answer">No, it’s not. Instead, it is transmitted via droplets.</p>
                        <p class="answer">Whenever someone coughs, sneezes, speaks, or even just exhales, tiny droplets of fluid are expelled from the mouth and nose. Some of these droplets are so small that they are invisible to the naked eye. If the virus that is present in these droplets enters a person’s body—most likely through their mouths, nose, or eyes—then they can get contaminated and infected by SARS-CoV-2, and become sick from COVID-19.</p>
                        <p class="answer">These droplets can be flung up to 3 meters away from their origin—so being closer than that to someone infected means you’ll be contaminated by these droplets immediately.</p>
                        <p class="answer">Further, these droplets eventually fall and coat all the surfaces around the original infected person. Studies have shown that coronaviruses can persist and live on surfaces for a few hours or up to several days (depending on the material, temperature, humidity, etc.) If someone touches a contaminated surface, then the virus can be transferred to their hands; when they eventually touch their face (specifically their mouth, nose, or eyes), the virus can enter their body and infect them. This is why proper hand-washing is so important.</p>
                        <p class="answer">There have been some experiments showing that the virus can be airborne or at least transmissible through aerosolized droplets—however, this has only been observed in the lab. Until new research conclusively proves airborne transmission, the medical consensus is to classify the disease as primarily droplet transmissible instead. </p>

This does not necessarily mean that you are sick. You are staying away from others to limit the chance of exposing them to the disease because you think that you may have been exposed to someone with the disease. Someone in self-quarantine stays separated from others, and they limit movement outside of their home or current place. A person may have been exposed to the virus without knowing it (for example, when traveling or out in the community), or they could have the virus without feeling symptoms. Quarantine helps limit further spread of COVID-19.</p>
